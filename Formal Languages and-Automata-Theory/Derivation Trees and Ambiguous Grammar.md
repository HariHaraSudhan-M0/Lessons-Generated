Remember those cool pattern-spotting machines we chatted about? The ones that can change their "situation" or "spot" (**states**) based on what they "read" (**input**)? And they follow clear guides (**transitions**) telling them exactly how to move from one state to another? We saw how they can follow a path as they process an input, like reading the letters in a word one by one, figuring out where they are based on what they've seen.

Let's jump back in with a fun little warm-up game! Imagine a super simple machine whose only job is to notice if you type the letters "GO" right after each other.

*   It starts in the **Waiting** state. It hasn't seen anything interesting yet.
*   If you type 'G', it gets hopeful! It moves to the **Seen G** state. It's like its memory now says, "Okay, I just saw a 'G'. If I see an 'O' next, I've got it!"
*   If you type 'O' *right after* typing 'G' (while it's in the **Seen G** state), bingo! It finds the pattern and moves to the special **Success!** state.
*   If you type *anything else* at any point, or if you type something wrong *after* seeing 'G' (like another 'G' or some other letter), the pattern is broken. It sighs and goes back to the **Waiting** state, needing to start its search for "GO" all over again.

Alright, grab a piece of paper or just trace in your mind! Let's follow this little machine's path for these inputs. Start in the **Waiting** state each time:

1.  Input: "GO" - What states does the machine visit, starting from **Waiting**? (Think: Waiting -> saw 'G' -> Seen G -> saw 'O' -> Success!)
2.  Input: "OG" - What states does it visit?
3.  Input: "GGO" - What states does it visit?
4.  Input: "STOP" - What states does it visit? (Hint: It only cares about 'G' and 'O'. What happens if it sees other letters?)

See how the machine's **state** is like a simple memory of the *recent* input it saw that matters for the pattern? And how the input symbol tells it exactly where to go next?

Now, think about that "GO" machine again. From the **Waiting** state, if you type 'G', there's only *one* possible place it goes: **Seen G**. If you type anything *else* it understands (like 'O', or even 'S', 'T', 'P' if we expanded its alphabet!), there's only *one* place it goes for each of those: **Waiting**. From the **Seen G** state, if you type 'O', you go *only* to **Success!**. If you type *anything else* it understands (like 'G'), you go *only* to **Waiting**.

For *every single* situation the machine can be in (**state**) and for *every single* possible letter it could read (**input symbol**), there is *exactly one* certain place it moves to next. No guessing, no options, just one clear, determined path.

Machines that work like this, where the very next step is *always* perfectly clear and certain, are very special! They are completely predictable pattern spotters.

In this lesson, we're going to dive deeper into these completely predictable pattern-spotting machines. You'll discover:

*   What makes a **Deterministic Finite Automaton** (**DFA**) so wonderfully predictable (the word "Deterministic" simply means "completely decided beforehand" or "certain"!).
*   The simple building blocks, like the essential pieces of our game, that make up a **DFA**.
*   How a **DFA** follows its strict, predictable rules to process an input, step-by-step, always taking just one certain path.
*   Where these certain machines quietly help us in the real world, quickly recognizing specific patterns in text or data.

Ready to explore the world of these certain, predictable pattern matchers? Let's embark on this journey together!

## The Predictable Machine: What is a DFA?

Imagine you're following a super simple, step-by-step instruction guide, maybe for assembling a small toy. At any point, you're at a specific step (**state**) in the guide (e.g., "Attached Part A to Part B", "Screwed on the wheels"). When you follow an instruction (**input**, like "Attach Part C" or "Turn Screw X"), the guide tells you *exactly* which *single* next step you should be at. It would never say, "After attaching Part B, maybe attach Part C, or perhaps put on the sticker, or maybe just take a break – see what feels right!". No, it's one instruction, one certain next step.

This idea of having just one single, certain path forward for every possible instruction you encounter is the heart of a **Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)**. It's a specific kind of the pattern-spotting machines (Finite Automata) we mentioned, but with this crucial rule:

For *every single* situation the machine can be in (its **state**) AND for *every single* possible symbol it might read from the input (from its allowed list of symbols, its **alphabet**), there is always and only *one* specific state it *must* move to next.

No choices, no alternatives, ever! That's what the important word "**Deterministic**" means here. The very next state the machine will be in is completely and surely **determined** (decided) *only* by its current state and the single input symbol it just read. It's like being on a train track where the track ahead is always clearly laid out, leading to one specific station from where you are right now.

> **Simple Picture:** Think about a simple on/off light switch. Its **states** are "On" and "Off". The **input** is your action, "Flick the switch". If the light is in the "Off" state, and you "Flick the switch" (input), the *only* certain next state is "On". If the light is in the "On" state, and you "Flick the switch" (input), the *only* certain next state is "Off". There's no state where flickering the switch *might* make it stay on or turn a different color (unless it's a different kind of switch!). For this simple switch, the next state is completely *determined* by the current state and the input action. A **DFA** works with input symbols instead of switch flicks, but the idea is the same: totally predictable next states for every situation and every possible input.

So, put simply, a **DFA** is a predictable pattern-spotting machine that reads symbols one by one, changes its internal "memory" or "spot" (**state**) according to strict, certain rules, and always knows *exactly* which single state it will be in next. Its journey through the states is totally predictable from beginning to end for any given input.

## The Building Blocks of a DFA (Like the Essential Pieces of Our Predictable Game)

Just like putting together a toy or following a recipe needs specific parts and instructions, **DFAs** are built using a few defined components. Think of these as the essential pieces you need to design your own predictable pattern-recognizing machine. Every **DFA** is completely described by these five specific things:

*   **States (often called Q):** This is simply a list or a collection of *all* the possible different situations, steps, or "places" the machine can possibly be in at any point. Like all the different positions on a simple board game track, or all the steps in our toy assembly guide. The machine is always sitting in *one* state at a time as it's working.
*   **Alphabet (often called Σ - that's the Greek letter Sigma):** This is the complete collection of *all* the possible input symbols the machine is built to read and understand. If our machine is looking for patterns in simple text, the alphabet might be letters (like 'a', 'b', 'c'). If it's looking at numbers, the alphabet might be digits ('0', '1', '2'). For our light switch analogy, the "alphabet" might just be {"Flick the switch"}. The machine *only* understands symbols from its specific alphabet.
*   **Transition Function (often called δ - that's the Greek letter Delta):** This is the most crucial part – it's the machine's complete, strict rulebook! It's like a detailed map or a set of instructions that tells you *exactly* which *single* state you *must* move to from your **current state** when you read a specific **input symbol**. It leaves no room for doubt. It's like the wiring of the light switch saying: "If you are 'Off', and the input is 'Flick', you *only* go to 'On'." We can imagine this rule like: δ(current state, input symbol) = the *one and only* next state. This rulebook *must* have an answer, a single destination state, for *every single* combination of a **current state** and an **input symbol** from the **alphabet**. This is the rule that makes it truly **Deterministic**!
*   **Start State (often called q₀):** This is one specific state from your collection of **States**. It's the unique place where the machine *always* begins its processing journey when it starts looking at an input string. Every **DFA** has exactly one **start state** – it's where the game always begins.
*   **Final States (often called F):** This is a collection (it can be one or more) of states from your list of **States**. These are the "goal" states, the "winning spots". If the machine finishes reading the *entire* input string and lands in one of these **final states**, it means the string "fits the pattern" the DFA was designed to find, and the string is **accepted**. If it finishes in a state that is *not* in this collection of **final states**, the string is **rejected** – it didn't successfully follow a path that ended in a winning spot.

**Quick Check:** Does a **DFA** always need states? Yes! It *must* have at least one state, which will also be its **start state**. All five of these parts work together perfectly to completely define a **DFA** and the specific patterns (sometimes called "languages" in computer science) it's built to recognize.

## How a DFA Processes a String (Like Following Instructions Step-by-Step)

Okay, let's see our predictable pattern-spotting machine in action! How does a **DFA** figure out if a given string of symbols, like "apple" or "110", is something it should **accept** because it matches its pattern rules? It's a very clear, completely predictable step-by-step process, much like carefully following that simple instruction guide or playing our predictable board game:

1.  **Get Set:** The machine always starts its journey in its special **start state**. This is its designated starting position.
2.  **Look at the First Instruction:** Read the very first symbol from the input string. This is your first command or "move instruction".
3.  **Check the Rulebook:** Now, use the **transition function (δ)**, the machine's strict rulebook. Look up your **current state** (where the machine is right now) and the specific symbol you just read (the instruction). The rulebook tells you *exactly* which single state you *must* move to next. There's no other choice allowed!
4.  **Make Your Determined Move:** Change the machine's **current state** to that one specific state the rulebook pointed to. You've now moved to a new position, completely decided by the rules and the input.
5.  **Keep Going Until Done:** If there are more symbols left in the input string, repeat the process starting from step 2. You read the *next* symbol and use your *new* current state and that symbol to look up the *next* determined state in the rulebook. You read one symbol, make one certain move, read the next, make the next move, and so on, until you have read and processed *every single* symbol in the input string.
6.  **Where Did You Land?:** Once you've read and processed the *very last* symbol of the input string, look at the state the machine is currently in. This is the final state it reached after following the path for the entire string.
7.  **Decide: Accept or Reject:** Is this final state one of the special **final states** (the winning spots) that were defined for this DFA?
    *   If **Yes**, the input string is **accepted** by the **DFA**. This means the string successfully guided the machine along a fully determined path that ended in a winning state – it fits the pattern the **DFA** was designed to find.
    *   If **No**, the input string is **rejected**. This means the path ended in a state that is *not* a winning state, so the string does not fit the pattern.

> **Simple Picture:** Imagine a simple combination lock where you have to dial numbers in a specific sequence to open it. The lock's **states** could represent how much of the correct sequence you've successfully dialed so far (e.g., "Waiting for first digit", "Seen first correct digit", "Seen first two correct", "Unlocked!"). The **input symbols** are the numbers you dial. The **transition function** is how the lock mechanically responds: "If you are 'Waiting for first digit' and dial the correct first number, the mechanism *must* click into the 'Seen first correct digit' state. If you dial *any* wrong number, the mechanism *must* reset you back to 'Waiting for first digit'." After you finish dialing all the numbers in your combination (the input string), if the lock ends up in the "Unlocked!" state (one of the **final states**), your combination is **accepted**! The path was completely determined by the numbers you dialed and the lock's strict mechanics.

Let's trace a simple example together using the DFA we talked about that accepts strings containing the sequence "01" *somewhere* within them. The alphabet is {'0', '1'}.

*   **States:**
    *   `q0`: Haven't just seen a '0', or the pattern progress was reset. (This is our **start state**).
    *   `q1`: Just saw a '0'. Ready for a '1' to complete "01".
    *   `q2`: Success! Have seen "01" at least once. (This is our **final state**!).
*   **Alphabet:** {'0', '1'}.
*   **Start State:** `q0`.
*   **Final States:** {`q2`}.
*   **Transitions** (Our Rulebook - one single next state for *every* state and *every* symbol!):
    *   From `q0`:
        *   If input is '0', go to `q1`. (δ(q0, '0') = q1)
        *   If input is '1', stay in `q0`. (δ(q0, '1') = q0)
    *   From `q1`:
        *   If input is '0', stay in `q1`. (Saw "00", last relevant thing is still a '0'. δ(q1, '0') = q1)
        *   If input is '1', go to `q2`. (Saw "01"! Found the pattern. δ(q1, '1') = q2)
    *   From `q2` (Once you're here, you've found "01", nothing can "un-find" it):
        *   If input is '0', stay in `q2`. (δ(q2, '0') = q2)
        *   If input is '1', stay in `q2`. (δ(q2, '1') = q2)

Now, let's trace the string "001" step-by-step following these rules:

1.  We start in state `q0`. Our input string is "001".
2.  Read the first symbol: '0'. We are in state `q0`, reading '0'. Our rulebook (transition function δ) says: δ(`q0`, '0') is `q1`. We *must* move to state `q1`. Remaining input: "01".
3.  Read the next symbol: '0'. We are now in state `q1`, reading '0'. Rulebook says: δ(`q1`, '0') is `q1`. We *must* stay in state `q1`. Remaining input: "1".
4.  Read the last symbol: '1'. We are now in state `q1`, reading '1'. Rulebook says: δ(`q1`, '1') is `q2`. We *must* move to state `q2`. Remaining input: "".
5.  We've read all the symbols. Our final state is `q2`. Is `q2` one of our **final states** (winning spots)? Yes! So, the string "001" is **accepted** by this **DFA**.

Let's trace "100":

1.  Start in state `q0`. Input string is "100".
2.  Read '1'. State `q0`, input '1'. Rule: δ(`q0`, '1') is `q0`. Stay in `q0`. Remaining: "00".
3.  Read '0'. State `q0`, input '0'. Rule: δ(`q0`, '0') is `q1`. Move to `q1`. Remaining: "0".
4.  Read '0'. State `q1`, input '0'. Rule: δ(`q1`, '0') is `q1`. Stay in `q1`. Remaining: "".
5.  End of string. Final state is `q1`. Is `q1` a **final state**? No. So, the string "100" is **rejected**.

See how the machine follows one single, absolutely predictable path determined *only* by the input symbols it reads and its strict, one-answer rules? It never has to guess or choose between paths!

We can think about the step-by-step logic a computer would follow to do this processing. We can write this logic down in **pseudo-code**. Pseudo-code isn't real code for any specific programming language; it's just a way to write down the steps clearly in simple English so we can understand the process logic:
// Imagine all the DFA's rules (states, alphabet, transitions, start state, final states)
// are organized neatly in a structure we'll call 'the_dfa_rules'.

// This is a process (like a small recipe) to check a string using our DFA:
function check_string_with_DFA (the_string_we_want_to_check, the_dfa_rules):

// Step 1: Get Set: Start at the very beginning state, as defined by the DFA rules.
current_state = the_dfa_rules.start_state

// Step 5: Keep Going Until Done: Now, we'll look at each symbol in the string,
// one by one, starting from the left.
for each symbol in the_string_we_want_to_check:

// Steps 3 & 4: Check the Rulebook and Make Your Determined Move:
// We ask the rulebook ('the_dfa_rules.transition_function'):
// "If I am in this 'current_state' and I read this 'symbol', where do I go?"
// IMPORTANT: The rulebook *always* has exactly ONE answer for this!
the_one_and_only_next_state = look_up_in_the_rulebook (current_state, symbol)

// Now, move the machine to that single, certain next state.
current_state = the_one_and_only_next_state
// Steps 6 & 7: Where Did You Land? Decide Accept or Reject:
// We've finished reading all the symbols. The machine is in its final 'current_state'.
// Is this final state one of the special 'final_states' listed in our DFA rules?
if current_state is included in the_dfa_rules.final_states:
// Yes! The string led us to a winning state.
return "Accepted" // The string fits the pattern!
else:
// No, the final state is not a winning state.
return "Rejected" // The string does not fit the pattern.


This **pseudo-code** clearly shows the simple, certain logic: start at the defined beginning state, process each input symbol using the strict, one-answer rules to find the *only* next state, and finally, check if the machine ended its journey on a winning state. Simple, predictable, and easy to follow!

## Designing Your Own DFA (Like Creating Your Own Pattern Game)

Creating a **DFA** to recognize a specific pattern (what computer scientists call a "**language**") is like designing your own simple path-following game. You need to figure out what important pieces of information the machine needs to "remember" about the input it has seen *so far* to know if it's currently on the right track to eventually reaching one of the "winning" **states**. These key pieces of memory or tracking progress become your different **states**!

Let's try designing a simple **DFA** to accept strings that end *exactly* with the sequence "ok". We'll use the letters 'o' and 'k' as our only input symbols, plus maybe "other" symbols (anything that isn't 'o' or 'k') just to be clear. What does our little machine need to keep track of as it reads the string, symbol by symbol, to know if it's currently in a situation that could lead to ending in "ok"?

It needs to know:
1.  Has it recently seen an 'o'? (This is important because an 'o' could be the first part of "ok").
2.  Has it recently seen "ok"? (This is the goal! If the string finishes right now, we win).
3.  Or has the pattern been broken, and it hasn't seen anything useful recently?

So, our **states** can represent these important memory situations:

*   `q0`: This is our default state. The machine hasn't just seen an 'o' that matters, or the potential "ok" pattern it was tracking got messed up by a wrong symbol. (This is our **start state**). It "remembers" nothing useful recently.
*   `q1`: The machine just saw an 'o'. It "remembers" it's in a hopeful situation where seeing a 'k' next would complete "ok".
*   `q2`: Success! The machine just saw "ok"! It "remembers" that the string *up to this point* ends in "ok". If the string finishes now, it's accepted. (This will be our **final state**!).

Our **Alphabet** is {'o', 'k', 'other'} (these are the only types of symbols this DFA understands). Our **Start State** is `q0` (always begin here). Our **Final States** are {`q2`} (only `q2` is a winning spot – if the machine ends its processing in this state, the string is accepted).

Now, let's define the **Transitions** (the rulebook - remember, strict rules for *every* state and *every* symbol type, with only *one* next state!):

*   From `q0` (Haven't just seen 'o', 'ok', or pattern reset):
    *   If input is 'o', the machine just saw an 'o'. This *could* start the "ok" pattern. Move to `q1`. (δ(q0, 'o') = q1)
    *   If input is 'k', the machine just saw 'k', but not after an 'o'. This doesn't help find "ok". Stay in `q0`. (δ(q0, 'k') = q0)
    *   If input is 'other', stay in `q0`. (Any other symbol doesn't help find "ok". δ(q0, 'other') = q0)
*   From `q1` (The machine just saw an 'o', hoping for a 'k' next):
    *   If input is 'o', the machine saw "oo". The *last* important thing it saw is *still* an 'o'. It's still in the situation of having just seen an 'o', waiting for a 'k'. Stay in `q1`. (δ(q1, 'o') = q1)
    *   If input is 'k', the machine saw "ok"! It completed the desired pattern ending! Move to `q2`. (δ(q1, 'k') = q2)
    *   If input is 'other', the pattern "o" followed by "other" is broken. Go back to the default `q0` state. (δ(q1, 'other') = q0)
*   From `q2` (The machine just saw "ok" - it's in a winning state currently!):
    *   If input is 'o', the machine saw something like "...oko". The string no longer *ends exactly* in "ok" (it ends in 'o'). BUT, the 'o' it just saw *could* be the start of a *new* "ok" ending if the very next symbol is 'k'. So, it needs to "remember" that it just saw an 'o', moving to state `q1`. (δ(q2, 'o') = q1)
    *   If input is 'k', the machine saw something like "...okk". The string no longer ends *exactly* in "ok" (it ends in 'k'). This 'k' doesn't help start a new "ok" sequence. The machine is back to the default situation where it hasn't seen anything useful recently. Go back to `q0`. (δ(q2, 'k') = q0)
    *   If input is 'other', the string no longer ends in "ok", and the 'other' symbol doesn't help start a new "ok". Go back to the default `q0` state. (δ(q2, 'other') = q0)

Let's trace "book" with our new DFA (assuming 'b' is 'other'):
1.  Start: `q0`. Input: "book".
2.  Read 'b' ('other'). Current `q0`, input 'other'. Rule: δ(q0, 'other') = `q0`. Current state is now `q0`. Remaining input: "ook".
3.  Read 'o'. Current `q0`, input 'o'. Rule: δ(q0, 'o') = `q1`. Current: `q1`. Remaining: "ok".
4.  Read 'o'. Current `q1`, input 'o'. Rule: δ(q1, 'o') = `q1`. Current: `q1`. Remaining: "k".
5.  Read 'k'. Current `q1`, input 'k'. Rule: δ(q1, 'k') = `q2`. Current: `q2`. Remaining: "".
6.  End of string. We finished in state `q2`. Is `q2` a **final state**? Yes. So, the string "book" is **accepted**.

Let's trace "roko":
1.  Start: `q0`. Input: "roko".
2.  Read 'r' ('other'). Current `q0`, input 'other'. Rule: δ(q0, 'other') = `q0`. Current: `q0`. Remaining: "oko".
3.  Read 'o'. Current `q0`, input 'o'. Rule: δ(q0, 'o') = `q1`. Current: `q1`. Remaining: "ko".
4.  Read 'k'. Current `q1`, input 'k'. Rule: δ(q1, 'k') = `q2`. Current: `q2`. Remaining: "o".
5.  Read 'o'. Current `q2`, input 'o'. Rule: δ(q2, 'o') = `q1`. Current: `q1`. Remaining: "".
6.  End of string. We finished in state `q1`. Is `q1` a **final state**? No. So, the string "roko" is **rejected**.

This careful, step-by-step process of thinking about what the machine needs to "remember" about the recent past (these become your **states**) and how each possible input symbol *predictably* changes that memory or situation (this defines the **transition function**) is the core idea behind designing **DFAs**! You're essentially mapping out all the possible certain paths the machine can take.

## DFAs in the Real World (They're Like Silent Pattern Spotters!)

**DFAs** aren't just interesting ideas for games; they are quiet, hardworking helpers performing tasks inside many computer programs. They are especially useful when a program needs to quickly and reliably find very specific patterns in text or data in a way that is completely predictable and leaves no room for ambiguity:

*   **Checking Your Computer Code:** When you write instructions for a computer (writing a program), another program called a **compiler** (or an **interpreter**) reads your code to turn it into something the computer can understand and run. The very first step for these programs is often like a **DFA** at work! It scans your code character by character to identify important chunks – things like special command words (like "if", "while", "for"), the names you gave to things, numbers, math symbols (+, =), etc. A **DFA** is perfect for quickly and certainly deciding things like: "Yes, this sequence of letters exactly matches the pattern for a valid command word" or "Yes, this sequence of digits exactly matches the pattern for a valid number". This initial scanning process is called **lexical analysis**, and **DFAs** are super important here because they are very fast and their outcome for any input is completely certain – just what you need when reading code!
*   **Finding Text Patterns Quickly:** Have you ever used the "Find" feature in a document or on a webpage to quickly locate a specific word or phrase? Or used search on your computer to find files that contain certain text patterns? Many of these search tools use engines that rely on **DFAs** or similar predictable concepts. The patterns you search for can often be described using something called a **regular expression** (a way to write down text patterns), and **DFAs** are used to quickly and surely check if a piece of text matches that pattern. Because **DFAs** are so efficient and their results so certain, they can scan through huge amounts of text very, very quickly.
*   **Checking if Input Looks Correct:** When you fill out a form online and it immediately tells you if your email address *looks like* a valid email format (does it have an '@' symbol and a '.' in the right places?) or if your phone number has the correct number of digits, that often involves a **DFA**-like process. It's a simple, quick check to see if the string you typed follows a very specific structural pattern *before* the form even tries to fully process the information. It's a certain way to check simple format rules.

**DFAs** are powerful in these situations because they are simple, completely predictable, and incredibly fast at making yes/no decisions based on whether an input string follows a defined pattern. If a pattern (a "**language**") can be recognized by a **DFA**, it's called a **regular language**. Understanding these kinds of patterns and the simple machines that can recognize them quickly and efficiently is a fundamental idea in computer science!

## Summary

Alright, let's quickly look back at our journey exploring predictable machines! We focused on the **Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)**. What's the biggest takeaway? It's a type of **state machine** that is perfectly predictable – from any **state** you're in, when you read an **input symbol**, there is *always only one* specific **state** you *will* move to next. This certainty is what "Deterministic" means – the next step is completely decided. No choices, no surprises, just one definite path!

We broke down the **DFA** into its five simple, essential components, like the necessary pieces and rules for our predictable game or instruction guide:
*   The collection of **states** (**Q**) (all the possible situations the machine can be in).
*   The **alphabet** (**Σ**) (all the possible input symbols it can read).
*   The **transition function** (**δ**) (the strict rulebook that says *exactly* where to go next for *every* combination of state and input symbol – this is what makes it deterministic!).
*   The single **start state** (**q₀**) (the one specific place the journey always begins).
*   The set of **final states** (**F**) (the "winning" states; ending here means the input string is **accepted**).

We walked through the step-by-step process of how a **DFA** reads an input string, moving predictably from state to state based *only* on the input symbols and the deterministic rules. The final decision to **accept** or **reject** the string is based purely on whether the very last state reached is one of the designated **final states**. We saw how these predictable machines are used in real-world computer tasks like scanning code, quickly finding text, and checking input formats because they are fast, simple, and their outcome is always certain.

So, **DFAs** are fantastic tools when the rules for recognizing a pattern are crystal clear and always lead to a single, definite next step. They are predictable, efficient, and powerful for recognizing simple patterns known as **regular languages**.

But what if a pattern was a little more complicated, or what if designing a predictable DFA felt too complex? What if a machine didn't *have* to be so rigid? What if, from one state, reading a symbol *could* potentially lead to *more than one* possible next state? Or what if it could even change its state *without* reading any input symbol at all? That kind of machine exists! It's less predictable than a DFA, but sometimes its flexibility makes it simpler to design for certain tasks, and it opens up new possibilities that we'll explore in our next lesson! Stay curious!
