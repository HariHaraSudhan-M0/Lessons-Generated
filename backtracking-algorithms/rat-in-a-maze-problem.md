Okay, I will create a lesson for absolute beginners based on your instructions. I'll focus on making it engaging, using simple language, and breaking down complex concepts into manageable parts.

Here's the lesson:

**Title: Finding the Best Deal: An Introduction to Algorithms**

**Introduction: The Problem of Choice**

Imagine you're at a market, looking for the best apples. There are several stalls, each selling apples at different prices. How do you find the cheapest apples without spending all day comparing prices? This is a problem algorithms can solve!

An **algorithm** is simply a set of instructions for solving a problem. Think of it like a recipe for your computer. In our case, the problem is finding the cheapest apples, and the algorithm will be our method to find them quickly and efficiently.

**Why Do We Need Algorithms?**

Algorithms help us make decisions in a systematic and efficient way. Without a good algorithm, you might end up buying the first apples you see (which might not be the cheapest!) or spend so long comparing that the market closes before you buy any.

In the world of computers, algorithms are essential for everything from searching the internet to playing games. They allow computers to do complex tasks quickly and accurately.

**Our Everyday Example: The Cheapest Apple Algorithm**

Let's create an algorithm to find the cheapest apples:

1.  **Start at the first stall.** Remember the price of apples at this stall.
2.  **Go to the next stall.** Compare the price of apples at this stall with the price you remembered from the first stall.
3.  **If the apples at the current stall are cheaper,** replace the remembered price with the new cheaper price.
4.  **Repeat steps 2 and 3** for all the stalls in the market.
5.  **The price you remember at the end is the cheapest price** in the market. Buy your apples from the stall with that price.

This simple process is an algorithm! You’ve just learned one.

**Breaking it Down Step-by-Step**

Let's walk through this algorithm with an example. Suppose there are four stalls:

*   Stall 1: Apples are $2 each.
*   Stall 2: Apples are $1 each.
*   Stall 3: Apples are $3 each.
*   Stall 4: Apples are $1.50 each.

Here’s how our algorithm works:

1.  **Start at Stall 1:** Remember $2.
2.  **Go to Stall 2:** $1 is cheaper than $2. Remember $1.
3.  **Go to Stall 3:** $3 is not cheaper than $1. Keep remembering $1.
4.  **Go to Stall 4:** $1.50 is not cheaper than $1. Keep remembering $1.

At the end, you remember $1, so you buy apples from Stall 2 because it has the cheapest apples.

**Pseudo-Code Example**

Here's how we can write this algorithm in **pseudo-code**. Pseudo-code is like writing instructions in plain English, so it is language-agnostic (not specific to any programming language):

```
Algorithm FindCheapestApples:
  Input: A list of apple prices at different stalls
  Output: The cheapest apple price

  RememberedPrice = price at first stall

  For each stall in the market:
    If price at current stall < RememberedPrice:
      RememberedPrice = price at current stall

  Return RememberedPrice
```

**Understanding the Logic**

The pseudo-code does exactly what we described.

*   It starts by remembering the price at the first stall.
*   Then, it goes through each stall, comparing the price.
*   If it finds a cheaper price, it updates what it remembers.
*   Finally, it returns the cheapest price it found.

**Why This Matters**

This simple algorithm illustrates the core idea behind many complex algorithms. By breaking down a problem into small steps and making decisions based on comparisons, we can solve problems efficiently.

**More complex algorithms**: Algorithms are the basic building block in any field. For example, **sorting algorithms** (arrange things in order), **searching algorithms** (look for something specific), and **pathfinding algorithms** (find the best route). You will learn this concept as you progress.

**Next Steps**

Now that you understand the basic idea of algorithms, think about other everyday problems you can solve with a similar approach. For example, how would you find the tallest person in a group or the shortest route to school?

**Summary**

In this lesson, you've learned what an algorithm is, why they are important, and how to create a simple algorithm to solve a real-world problem. You've also seen how to write this algorithm in pseudo-code. Remember, algorithms are just a set of instructions to solve a problem, and they are all around us!
